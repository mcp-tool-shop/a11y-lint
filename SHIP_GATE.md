---

## A. Security Baseline

- [x] `[all]` SECURITY.md exists (report email, supported versions, response timeline) (2026-02-27)

- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server

## B. Error Handling

- [x] `[all]` Errors follow the Structured Error Shape: `code`, `message`, `hint`, `cause?`, `retryable?` (2026-02-27) — A11yMessage with code, what, why, fix (exceeds Tier 1)
- [x] `[cli]` Exit codes: 0 ok · 1 user error · 2 runtime error · 3 partial success (2026-02-27) — 0=clean, 1=errors found
- [x] `[cli]` No raw stack traces without `--debug` (2026-02-27) — Click handles exceptions
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[mcp]` SKIP: not an MCP server
- [ ] `[desktop]` SKIP: not a desktop app
